How to Compile:
===============
    Special instructions (if any) for compiling the code for each part of the assignment.  It is unlikely that you will have any special instructions
    At the very least, you should include a javac command for each part of the assignment: For example:
    Part 1:
        javac ProbeHTInc.java
    Part 2:
        javac WordReduction.java
    Part 3:
        javac ReadCSV.java
    Part 4:
        javac Map151Interface.java
       
How to Run:
===========
    Special instructions (if any) for running your code of each part of the assignment
    At the very least, here you should say what class contains the main method that you intend to illustrate the runtime behavior of your program.
    
    Word Reduction is run by running the program like normal and adding a word
    in which you would like to check if it can be reduced to make another word
    till it is reached to two letters. You can check multiple words at a time 
    by seperating them with a space as shown below

    Part 1:

Reflection:
===========
This assignment was pretty zen though at first I did not understand recursion 
at all. I did not understand backtracking either now after this assignment I
think I have a better grasp of it. Plannning it a week before starting the code
helped. Though the planning was not perfect it was fixed when actually programing.
Thank you for the chill assignment unless there is more to it than i thought.
